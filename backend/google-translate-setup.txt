# Google Cloud Translation API Setup

1. Go to https://cloud.google.com/translate and click "Get started for free".
2. Sign in with your Google account and create a new project.
3. Enable the Cloud Translation API for your project.
4. Set up billing (required, but you get $300 free credits for 90 days).
5. Create an API key:
   - Go to APIs & Services > Credentials > Create credentials > API key.
   - Copy the API key.
6. Restrict your API key to only allow requests from your website (optional but recommended).
7. In your React project, add your API key to your .env file:
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_KEY=your_api_key_here
8. Update your translateText function to use Google Translate API:
   POST https://translation.googleapis.com/language/translate/v2?key=YOUR_API_KEY
   with body: { q: "text", target: "fr" }

See https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/reference/rest/v2/translate for full API docs.

Let your developer update the code to use this API for dynamic translation.
